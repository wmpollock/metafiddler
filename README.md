## Background

music.metafilter.com was about few months old when I first discovered it in 2006.  Much of the OG content was folks cleaning out their old recordings but in short order musicians were using it as another outlet for their online music and part if not an exclusive part of their site persona.  Contests drove thematic submissions and a growing body of really decent, earnest music was there for the mining.

This wasn't going to be anything you'd ever heard before and from people you'd never see.  Better, it was a curatable stream.

There's something in my gatherer's heart that got bitten hard by music collection in the early web days when things were free and easy and _weird_.  So many oddities just avaialble there and maybe never seen again.

I didn't want to miss anything good so when I started I started at the first track which was a public radio interview of the site's founder.  I think its a hidden track.

From there down the sequential road I travelled.

I cobbled up a web interface wrapper but I wanted a headless interface, one I didn't need to select into, it would just be there, monitoring and running.

And here we are :D
